### Graph module

Goals:
 * to learn about graphs, and apply learnings to my [bigger project](https://fir-sandbox-2.lamdera.app/)
 * to make a basic in-memory property graph, inpsired by Neo4J
 * to make a simple [Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language))-like DSL to query the graph

Non-goals:
 * to make a module with even a semblance of production readiness
 * to comply to Cypher/Neo4J standards
 * to write "good code"
